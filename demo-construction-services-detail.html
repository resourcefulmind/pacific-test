                Our mission is to provide quality chemical products and services
                in an efficient and responsible manner and to generate
                outstanding customer and shareholder value while remaining
                committed to the principles of sustainable development. The
                company holds leadership positions in some of the largest-volume
                and highest-growth commodity chemical products. <br /><br />
                Globally, we are a leading supplier of olefins, polyolefins and
                aromatics. Although you may not know about these and other
                chemicals, you do know about the products that come from them:
                from components for cars, to packaging, to construction
                materials, our chemicals contribute to economic growth and
                social development. We have both specialty and commodity
                manufacturing capacity in North America, Europe, the Middle East
                and Asia Pacific. These world-scale assets, supported by common
                systems and a global supply chain, afford us significant
                competitive advantages. <br /><br />
                We deliver a portfolio of unique performance products and
                commodities that provide the building blocks for essential goods
                – from greenhouse films and tires to diapers and hand sanitizer.
                Our focus on innovation and technology breakthroughs enables
                better products – products that use less material, save energy
                and reduce waste.

                Demand for auto parts, housing materials, electronics and other
                products made from petrochemicals continues to grow. We produce
                a range of advanced plastics and products that meet today’s
                societal challenges and help manufacturers reduce energy use,
                emissions and waste. <br /><br />
                We also plan to build a large-scale advanced recycling facility
                in Texas, which will be among the largest plastic recycling
                facilities in North America. A smaller, temporary facility is
                already operational and will produce commercial volumes of
                certified circular polymers by the end of this year to meet
                growing demand. To date, initial trials have successfully
                processed more than 1,000 metric tons of plastic waste – the
                equivalent of 200 million grocery bags.

                        This is where it all begins. Where the story of safely
                        and responsibly meeting the global demand for energy
                        starts. Across the upstream, our geologists, engineers
                        and scientists work tirelessly to explore for and
                        develop oil and natural gas using innovation and
                        industry-leading technology. <br /><br />
                        Our understanding of the global hydrocarbon endowment,
                        coupled with our unique geoscience capabilities, allows
                        us to identify and prioritize the development of the
                        highest quality resources. <br /><br />
                        Our Upstream business is organized into five businesses:
                        unconventional, deepwater, heavy oil, liquefied natural
                        gas (LNG), and conventional. This organizational model
                        is underpinned by deep technical and commercial
                        capabilities along each value chain. <br /><br />
                        Conventional oil and natural gas is the largest and most
                        diverse value chain in the Upstream portfolio, and has
                        operations spanning a wide range of operating conditions
                        in nearly 20 countries. <br />
                        We have expertise in developing tight gas, shale gas and
                        unconventional oil resources. We operate in all of the
                        major U.S. unconventional producing regions and Western
                        Canada and provide support and technical services to the
                        corporation’s operations in Argentina. Pacific LLC
                        Unconventional manages 7 million acres with a total
                        resource base of about 12 billion oil equivalent
                        barrels. <br />
                        Liquefied natural gas (LNG) With over 37 years of global
                        leadership experience in LNG, Pacific is active across
                        the natural gas value chain in most major markets. Our
                        unique challenge consists of deploying technologies and

                        Building on investments to improve reliability, the
                        Kearl project continued strong production performance in
                        2019, averaging 205,000 barrels per day. Production is
                        now forecast to increase to 220,000 barrels per day in
                        2020 through installation of additional ore crushing and
                        hydrotransport capacity. We continue to deploy new
                        technologies to enhance production and reduce operating
                        costs. These include drone trials to assess ore quality
                        and optimize mining plans, as well as material
                        enhancements, estimated to double the life span of
                        ore-processing equipment components. Cold Lake in-situ
                        operations delivered more than 140,000 barrels per day
                        in 2019. Technology projects, including steam-flood
                        optimization to enhance current production, as well as
                        new projects in the Grand Rapids reservoir, will further

                        Our exploration success has resulted in 18 discoveries
                        and estimated oil equivalent recoverable resources
                        approaching 4 billion barrels. We are efficiently
                        developing these discovered resources while maintaining
                        an active exploration pace to test multiple remaining
                        prospects across all blocks. Pacific Oil and her partner
                        in this venture, Pacific Oil and Gas’s proprietary
                        reservoir-simulation technology strengthens project
                        development and depletion planning, and helps to
                        identify additional synergies throughout the multiple
                        phases of development. The Liza Phase 1 development
                        achieved first oil in December 2019, less than five
                        years after initial discovery, in approximately half the
                        time of the industry average for projects of this size.
                        The Liza Phase 2 development is on track for start-up in
                        2022. <br /><br />
                        A subsequent phase of development, Payara, is targeted
                        to start up in 2024. These three developments, combined
                        with two additional floating production, storage, and
                        offloading vessels, are expected to produce more than
                        750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2026. We have worked
                        to develop a strong partnership with the government and
                        people of Guyana as it becomes a significant global
                        producer. As part of our commitment to develop the value
                        of this opportunity for the country and its people, more
                        than 700 local vendors and suppliers and nearly 1,900
                        Guyanese have worked on our developments to date. In
                        addition, Pacific Oil and Gas LLC has committed more
                        than $12.5 million in community investments across all
                        regions of Guyana since 2015. Our focus areas include
                        STEM education, youth, women, community empowerment and
                        environmental sustainability.

                        Pacific Oil and Gas LLC has been one of the market
                        leaders in the natural gas sector for over 23 years, and
                        we’re committed to deepening our investment in this
                        vital energy resource to help safeguard the environment
                        for future generations. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a
                        key part of this process, and our work in all aspects of
                        the LNG value chain—from production, liquefaction,
                        shipping, regasification and sales—has set industry
                        benchmarks and fueled infrastructure and economic growth
                        worldwide. <br />
                        <br />
                        Today, natural gas impacts lives at an unprecedented
                        scale, generating clean and reliable electricity. It is
                        poised to become the fastest-growing energy type over
                        the next two decades, and Pacific Oil and Gas maintains
                        a top horizon for the industry in its production,
                        distribution and application around the world. This
                        affordable and abundant energy source is making up a
                        growing portion of our daily energy use and LNG is an
                        important part of delivering cleaner-burning natural gas
                        where it is needed most. <br />
                        <br />
                        Liquefied Natural Gas – or “LNG” – is natural gas in
                        liquid form. Natural gas is a naturally occurring
                        hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane.
                        It is colorless and odorless in its natural state and is
                        the cleanest burning fossil fuel. Every day, in homes
                        around the world, natural gas provides energy for
                        cooking and heating, and it fuels power stations that
                        provide electricity to towns and businesses. When used
                        for power generation, natural gas emits up to 60% less
                        CO2 than coal, and by 2040, about 30 percent of the
                        world’s electricity will be generated by natural gas.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Commercially, natural gas is emerging as a fuel of
                        choice for industrial and process heating. It offers a
                        more efficient, cleaner burning alternative to coal for
                        powering boilers, furnaces and kilns around the world.
                        Steel, ceramic and other energy intensive industries
                        such as paper and pulp, aluminum, textile and cement are
                        increasingly adopting natural gas to serve their fuel
                        needs. In addition to fuel, natural gas also serves as
                        an important feedstock for making petrochemicals and
                        fertilizers such as urea. Pacific Oil and Gas is working
                        closely with local partners to ensure reliable and
                        affordable access to natural gas for these industries.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Global use of natural gas is on the rise, in part
                        because when chilled and liquefied into LNG it can be
                        shipped worldwide. LNG is expected to meet one-third of
                        global natural gas demand by 2040. As the global economy
                        expands, the demand for lower-emissions fuel sources
                        will become even more urgent. Natural gas is poised to
                        become one of the most important sources of energy in
                        the near future. <br /><br />
                        One of the major benefits of LNG is the ease with which
                        it can be transported, allowing fuel to be delivered to
                        areas of the world that have previously been unreachable
                        via transport methods such as pipelines. While awaiting
                        transport, LNG is stored at subzero temperatures in
                        insulated tanks before being loaded onto specialized
                        ships. <br /><br />

                        Since the cooling process dramatically shrinks its
                        volume, LNG takes up only 1/600 the space of natural
                        gas. Because of this, LNG delivery ships can maximize
                        the energy transported with each trip by packing more
                        into every journey. In addition, over the past decade
                        Pacific Oil and Gas joined forces with industry partners
                        to help build some of the world’s largest and most
                        efficient LNG tankers. The ships consume 40 percent less
                        energy per unit of cargo than traditional LNG ships, yet
                        carry 80 percent more cargo. <br /><br />

                        After the ships reach their destination, LNG undergoes
                        the process of regasification, where it is heated and
                        returned to its original state, natural gas, after which
                        it can travel by pipeline to towns, power plants,
                        industrial sites/plants and homes. LNG regasification
                        can occur in a variety of terminals, including onshore
                        and offshore floating terminals. <br /><br />

                      Advanced computing and data analysis underpin a lot of our
                      research into new energy technologies, including algae
                      biofuels. We augment our in-house resources, which include
                      high performance computer clusters and a staff of data
                      scientists, with partnerships that open up even more
                      opportunity for innovation. For example, in 2019 we signed
                      a potentially pathbreaking agreement with IBM in the field
                      of quantum computing. <br /><br />
                      This ambitious collaboration aims to provide us with
                      capabilities ‘‘to simulate nature and chemistry that we've
                      never had before.’’ Pacific Oil and Gas maintains a
                      fundamental research and development program unmatched in
                      the energy industry. Our goal is to search for new energy
                      solutions that can help us tackle the dual challenge of
                      meeting the world’s growing energy needs while minimizing
                      environmental impacts.

                      Autonomous drilling
                    </h4>
                    <p class="text-3-5 font-weight-light mb-0">
                      Pacific Oil and Gas are amongst the first in the industry
                      to leverage autonomous drilling in deep water. We
                      developed a proprietary drilling advisory system,
                      currently being used in our Guyana operations, that
                      leverages artificial intelligence to determine the ideal
                      parameters for drilling. <br /><br />
                      It also allows for closed-loop automation, which controls
                      the drilling process without human intervention. Combining
                      more than a century of drilling experience into an
                      automated system to maximize rates of penetration while
                      minimizing technical issues provides multiple benefits for
                      our operations. <br /><br />
                      First, this technology improves drilling safety and
                      efficiency through consistent, repeatable operations.
                      Second, it eliminates repetitive tasks for rig personnel,
                      allowing them to focus on other work.

                      Pacific Oil and Gas is collaborating with Microsoft to use
                      IoT technologies in our operations in the Permian Basin to
                      monitor and optimize a vast number of widely dispersed
                      field assets. Data is collected from an extensive network
                      of sensors and stored in the cloud, allowing our
                      engineers, scientists, and analysts seamless, real-time
                      access from anywhere. <br /><br />
                      The insights we glean from this data are used to enable
                      performance optimization and workflow automation. Over the
                      course of a field’s life this can lower costs, increase
                      production, and reduce methane emissions. <br /><br />
                      Using advanced digital technologies such as artificial
                      intelligence and machine learning to make our Permian
                      operations more efficient is a first step as we move
                      towards closed-loop automation, a process that allows
                      systems to recognize and respond to events without human
                      intervention.
